# Terrifi Provider

Terrifi is a Terraform provider and CLI for managing Ubiquiti UniFi network infrastructure. The provider communicates with the UniFi API to create, read, update, and delete network configuration such as DNS records, networks, WLANs, firewall zones, firewall policies, and client devices. The CLI provides tools for importing existing infrastructure into Terraform, verifying controller connectivity, and browsing the device fingerprint database.

We leverage hardware-in-the-loop testing to ensure that all resources are fully functional with real UniFi hardware.

## Example Usage

### Environment variable configuration

```terraform
provider "terrifi" {}
```

Set the following environment variables:

- `UNIFI_API` — Controller URL, including the port.
- `UNIFI_API_KEY` OR `UNIFI_USERNAME` and `UNIFI_PASSWORD` - either the API key or the username and password are required to authenticate with the controller. The API key is preferred, as it's arguably more secure and I've seen instances of rate-limiting with the username and password.
- `UNIFI_INSECURE` — Set to `true` if the controller is using a self-signed TLS certificate.
- `UNIFI_RESPONSE_CACHING` — Set to `true` to cache GET responses from v2 API endpoints, reducing load on the controller.

### Explicit configuration

```terraform
provider "terrifi" {
  api_url          = "https://192.168.1.1"
  api_key          = var.unifi_api_key
  site             = "default"
  allow_insecure   = true
  response_caching = true
}
```


## Schema

- `api_url` (String) — URL of the UniFi controller API. Do not include the `/api` path — the SDK discovers API paths automatically to support both UDM-style and classic controller layouts. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_API` environment variable.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) — API key for the UniFi controller. If set, `username` and `password` are ignored. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `username` (String, Sensitive) — Local username for the UniFi controller API. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_USERNAME` environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) — Password for the UniFi controller API. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `site` (String) — The UniFi site to manage. Defaults to `default`. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_SITE` environment variable.
- `allow_insecure` (Boolean) — Skip TLS certificate verification. Useful for local controllers with self-signed certs. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_INSECURE` environment variable.
- `response_caching` (Boolean) — Cache GET responses from v2 API endpoints during a single Terraform run. Reduces duplicate list-all calls for firewall zones and policies, which is especially helpful on low-end hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi). Any write operation invalidates the cache. Can also be set with the `UNIFI_RESPONSE_CACHING` environment variable.

## Performance on Low-End Hardware

If the UniFi controller is running on low-end hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi), Terraform's default parallelism of 10 concurrent operations can overwhelm the API server, causing slowdowns or crashes.

**Reduce parallelism** to limit concurrent API requests:

```sh
tofu plan -parallelism=1
tofu apply -parallelism=1
```

You can experiment with intermediate values like `-parallelism=2` or `-parallelism=5` to find the right balance between speed and stability.

**Enable response caching** to eliminate duplicate API calls. Firewall zones and policies use v2 API endpoints that only support list-all (no GET-by-ID), so N resources of the same type produce N identical API calls during the refresh phase. With response caching enabled, the first call is served from the controller and subsequent identical calls are served from an in-memory cache. Any write operation (create, update, delete) invalidates the cache automatically.

```terraform
provider "terrifi" {
  response_caching = true
}
```

Or via environment variable:

```sh
export UNIFI_RESPONSE_CACHING=true
```

## Authentication

The provider supports two authentication methods:

1. **API key** (`api_key`) — Recommended. When set, `username` and `password` are ignored.
2. **Username + password** (`username` and `password`) — Legacy local-account authentication.

The API key is preferred, as it's arguably more secure and I've seen instances of rate-limiting with the username and password.

## CLI

The Terrifi CLI is a companion tool for working with UniFi controllers. It can generate Terraform import blocks from live infrastructure, verify connectivity, and browse the device fingerprint database.

### Install

```sh
go install github.com/alexklibisz/terrifi/cmd/terrifi@latest
```

### Configuration

The CLI uses the same `UNIFI_*` environment variables as the provider (see above).

### Commands

#### check-connection

Verify that your environment variables are configured correctly:

```sh
terrifi check-connection
```

#### generate-imports

Generate Terraform `import {}` and `resource {}` blocks for a resource type, making it easy to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management:

```sh
terrifi generate-imports <resource_type>
```

Supported resource types:

| Resource Type | Description | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| `terrifi_client_device` | Client devices (aliases, fixed IPs, etc.) | [client_device](resources/client_device.md) |
| `terrifi_client_group` | Client groups | [client_group](resources/client_group.md) |
| `terrifi_device_ports` | Port profile and name assignments on device ports | [device_ports](resources/device_ports.md) |
| `terrifi_dns_record` | DNS records | [dns_record](resources/dns_record.md) |
| `terrifi_firewall_zone` | Firewall zones | [firewall_zone](resources/firewall_zone.md) |
| `terrifi_firewall_policy` | Firewall policies | [firewall_policy](resources/firewall_policy.md) |
| `terrifi_firewall_policy_order` | Firewall policy ordering | [firewall_policy_order](resources/firewall_policy_order.md) |
| `terrifi_network` | Networks | [network](resources/network.md) |
| `terrifi_port_profile` | Switch port profiles | [port_profile](resources/port_profile.md) |
| `terrifi_wlan` | Wireless networks | [wlan](resources/wlan.md) |

Example:

```sh
terrifi generate-imports terrifi_dns_record > imports.tf
```

This produces output like:

```terraform
import {
  id = "abc123"
  to = terrifi_dns_record.web_example_com
}

resource "terrifi_dns_record" "web_example_com" {
  name        = "web.example.com"
  value       = "192.168.1.100"
  record_type = "A"
}
```

You can then run `terraform plan` to verify and `terraform apply` to complete the import.

#### list-device-types

Browse the UniFi controller's fingerprint database to find device type IDs. These IDs can be used as `dev_id_override` values to set custom icons on client devices. Outputs CSV by default:

```sh
terrifi list-device-types > device_types.csv
```

Use the `--html` flag to generate a browsable HTML page (`unifi-device-types.html`) with device icons, fuzzy search, and filterable type/vendor dropdowns:

```sh
terrifi list-device-types --html
```

The HTML page loads device icons from Ubiquiti's CDN (`https://static.ui.com/fingerprint/0/{id}_257x257.png`) and uses [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) for fuzzy search. Search results are ranked by relevance, and the type/vendor dropdowns update dynamically to only show options that match the current filters.
